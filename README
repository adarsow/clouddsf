The Cloud Decision Support Framework helps decision makers, who consider the migration of an existing application to the Cloud. It is based on an approach of Andrikopoulos et al. (2013) considering a vision of a decision support system for Cloud migration. By this, decision makers are supported through focusing on decisions and supporting tasks that are important to be addressed when intending an application migration to the Cloud.

The CloudDSF is online available at http://www.clouddsf.com.

at IAAS (University Stuttgart) by Alexander Darsow.
